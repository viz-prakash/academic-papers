Summary of [I'm a Professor, which isn't usually a dangerous job Internet-Facilitated Harassment and its Impact on Researchers.pdf](https://github.com/viz-prakash/academic-papers/files/7156173/I.m.a.Professor.which.isn.t.usually.a.dangerous.job.Internet-Facilitated.Harassment.and.its.Impact.on.Researchers.pdf)

In this paper, the authors study internet-based harassment and its impact on academic researchers, in the world where the primary goal of the research is the impact that needs to be made publicly available. They study the motivation of harassers and their means. They also discuss how targets deal with the harassment, what are the current remediation strategies, and recommend more ways to handle internet-based harassment. They also discuss the future work for this study.

They suggested there are three primary motivations for harassers:
1. Self-preservation: where research could directly affect the harassers and their goal is to stop the research. This is more targeted and private.
2. Idealogical: where research doesn't match with harassers idealogy and they feel offended and their goal is to discredit the research
3. Performative: where research has nothing to do with the harassers but they find self-fulfillment and joy harassing, like bullying. This is opportunistic and public.

Current remediation strategies vary from not paying attention to harassers, to taking legal action against them. Later one is rare and that is where institutions and communities lack to offer support. Authors suggested remediation techniques range from personal suggestions, like researchers should have standard internet security hygiene, e.g. strong passwords and 2FA and should seek public support groups, to institutional where they suggest institute should offer training on how to deal with internet-based harassment. 

Suggested future work is to determine the exact scope of this problem and its harm and efficacy and viability of potential solutions. They suggest the creation of a researcher-specific peer network to build the support structure for a researcher in the public eye. They also suggest finding out why researchers don't get institutional support facing this problem.

**Questions**: the exact financial motive of harassers who go beyond normal means and use their network to harass researchers to stop/discredit the research?
